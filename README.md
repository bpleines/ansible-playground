<h1>Ansible Playground</h1>
</head>
<body>
This is a simple Ansible role to show off some basic features of Ansible in a graphical manner. It's a good way to see some basic linux filesystem tasks on your local machine. It's designed so that you can clone the repo and learn some Ansible while offline (on a plane perhaps?).
<br>
<h2>Steps to engage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install Ansible on your linux machine (I used v2.2)</li>
<li>Navigate to the project's top level directory, you should see myplaybook.yml</li>
<li>Enter the command <i>ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml -vvv -step</i> to begin execution of the playbook
